============
Test Scripts
============

Test scripts are located in the IT Mill Toolkit repository branch to
be tested. You should probably make a symbolic link from the directory
where you are running automated tests to the source code tree.

Example layout:

-- /root (testing root)
 |-- autobuilder
 | |
 | |-- trunk
 | | `-- build/testing/scripts     - Test scripts for trunk
 | |
 | `-- branches
 |   `-- 5.2
 |     `-- build/testing/scripts   - Test scripts for 5.2 branch
 |
 `-- testing                       - Automated test configuration and results
   |
   |-- trunk
   | |-- config.xml                - Configuration for testing the trunk
   | |-- scripts                   - ln -s ../../autobuilder/trunk/testing/scripts
   | `-- results                   - Result directory containing reports
   |
   `-- branch-5.2
     |-- config.xml                - Configuration for testing the trunk
     |-- scripts                   - ln -s ../../autobuilder/trunk/testing/scripts
     `-- results                   - Result directory containing reports

isolating the problem.
