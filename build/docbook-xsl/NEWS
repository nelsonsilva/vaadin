Release: 1.71.0

The following is a list of changes that have been made since the 1.70.1
release.

Common

The following changes have been made to the common code since the 1.70.1
release.

  * Further tinkering with sidebar handling. Think I got it right this
    time. (re)closes bug 1541793. Thanks to Mauritz Jeanson.

  * To make DocBook4-valid (the build ends up validing output of this
    using xjparse), replaced author/orgname with corpauthor and
    replaced all instances of tag with sgmltag.

  * Added reference.autolabel parameter for controlling labels on
    reference output.

  * Did some touch-ups to a few files to ensure that building from PDF
    and text from reference.dbk will work.

  * Support rows that are *completely* overlapped by the preceding row

  * New modules for supporting indexing extensions.

  * Merged ref.css into reference.css, deleted ref.css, and updated
    stylesheet to use reference.css instead of ref.css. Also changed
    individual reference pages to use graphical admonitions.

  * Added IDs in a number of places that should have time.

  * Added normalization to object.title.markup.textonly mode, reverted
    copyright link template in html/chunk-common.xsl to use it, and
    updated a couple of places in manpages that should have already
    been using it instead of object.title.markup.

  * Fix attribute name

  * fixed bug #1528002 olinks not handling dbhtml dir

  * Fixed bug #1539010, fix xml.base.dirs template to stop recursing
    if hit an absolute uri.

  * Corrected XPath expression used for finding date data within *info
    content -- such that dbtimestamp PIs are now correctly processed
    when they occur within refentry *info content.

  * Removed svn:executable property from many xml and xsl files on
    which it had been inadvertently (CVS legacy).

  * Support startinglinenumber on orderedlist

  * fixed lang entity to remove en appendage

Extensions

The following changes have been made to the extensions code since the 1.70.1
release.

    lowercase "java", "perl", and "idl"). Also support "c++" and "C++"
    (instead of just "cpp").

  * Rearranged templates for the 3 indexing methods
    and changed method named 'english' to 'basic'.

    FO and HTML stylesheets, added support for correctly processing
    Affiliation and Jobtitle.

    (instead of just "cpp").

    Affects HTML, FO, and manpages output. Closes bug 1552332. Thanks
    to "Brian A. Vanderburg II".

      displayed as inline content rather than as block content.

    othercredit.like.author.enabled:
      If non-zero, output of the othercredit element on titlepages is
      displayed in the same style as author and editor output. If zero
      (the default), othercredit output is displayed using a style
      different than that of author and editor.

    blurb.on.titlepage.enabled:
      If non-zero, output from authorblurb and personblurb elements is
      displayed on title pages. If zero (the default), output from
      those elements is suppressed on title pages (unless you are
      using a titlepage customization that causes them to be included).

    editedby.enabled
      If non-zero (the default), a localized Edited by heading is
      displayed above editor names in output of the editor element.

  * Added normalization to object.title.markup.textonly mode, reverted
    copyright link template in html/chunk-common.xsl to use it, and
    updated a couple of places in manpages that should have already

  * Corrected XPath expression used for locating first legalnotice
    instance in a document. Closes request #1476450. Thanks to Sam
    Steingold.

  * Correctly handle sidebar instances that have sidebar/info/title
    instead of sidebar/title. This change simply makes sidebar
    handling for this case identical to that of abstract. Closes bug
    #1541793. Thanks to Mauritz Jeanson.

  * Further refinement to cause nested QandASet to appear in top-level
    TOC. Patch from Daniel Leidert. Closes patch #1509018.

  * Fixed bug #1541113 predicate bugs in next/previous

  * fixed bug #1528002 olinks not handling dbhtml dir

  * Fixed bug #1537076 where sectioninfo/keywordset was not being processed.

  * Add Xalan variant to test for exslt:node-set function.
    Xalan can use function named node-set(), but doesn't
    recognize it using function-available().

  * Add curly braces around &lang; in xsl:sort lang attribute to make it an AVT.

  * Added support to FO stylesheets for handling instances of Org
    where it occurs outside of *info content. In HTML stylesheets,
    moved handling of Org out of info.xsl and into inline.xsl. In both
    FO and HTML stylesheets, added support for correctly processing
    Affiliation and Jobtitle.

  * Don't output punctuation between Refname and Refpurpose if
    Refpurpose is empty. Also corrected handling of Refsect2/title
    instances, and removed some debugging stuff that was generated in
    manpages output to mark the ends of sections.

  * Added new email.delimiters.enabled param. If non-zero (the
    default), delimiters are generated around e-mail addresses (output
    of the email element). If zero, the delimiters are suppressed.

  * Fixed handling of punctuation for methodparam in methodsynopsis.
    Closes bug 1530558. Thanks to Evan Goer and Michael Fuchs.

  * Removed svn:executable property from many xml and xsl files on
    which it had been inadvertently (CVS legacy).

  * Further changes related to handling when qanda.nested.in.toc is
    non-zer0; deal also with answer/qandaset instances (which are
    valid in DocBook 5).

  * Added qanda.nested.in.toc param. Default value is zero. If
    non-zero, instances of "nested" Qandaentry (ones that are children
    of Answer elements) are displayed in the TOC. Closes patch 1509018
    (from Daniel Leidert). Currently on affects HTML output (no patch
    for FO output provided).

  * Made changes to correct handling of nested answer/qandaentry
    instances. Closes bug 1509043. Thanks to Daniel Leidert.

    To avoid code duplication, part of the change involved adding a
    new process.qandaset named template and moving the code for output
    of all the question/answer table markup into that template.

  * Removed obsolete DL instances from biblio.xsl that were causing
    invalid XHTML output. Closes bug 1509041. Thanks to Daniel
    Leidert.

  * Used copy-of instead of value-of with biblioentry.item.separator,
    so that it can contain linebreaks. Closes bug 1509021. Patch from
    Daniel Leidert.

  * Improved handling of relative locations generated files

  * Fix functionsynopsis presentation

  * fixed lang entity to remove en appendage

  * fixed bug 1497436 confirm @cols is a number

    not yet supported.

  * Moved XSL stylesheets out of docsrc dir and into tools/xsl/build

    385940. Thanks to Daniel Leidert and Jakub Wilk.

  * Correctly handle lists that have block content before the actual
    list items. Closes bug #1547511. Thanks to Daniel Leidert. Also,
    attempt to be smarter about adding space after lists where needed.

  * Adjusted normalization of person-names. The person.name.normalized
    template now checks the RTF of output from person.name template
    node-by-node, and does normalization only on the nodes that need
    it. Also fixed normalization of email output for the metadata
    comment part of the man page, such that normalization is done
    before the angle brackets are added.

  * Added normalization to object.title.markup.textonly mode, reverted
    copyright link template in html/chunk-common.xsl to use it, and
    updated a couple of places in manpages that should have already
    been using it instead of object.title.markup.

  * Added person.name.normalized template to cause contents of author,
    editor, etc., names to be normalized. Also added normalization in
    several others places in *info output that lacked it. Thanks to
    Daniel Leidert.

  * Properly process collabname, corpauthor, corpcredit, orgname, and
    publishername before normalizing.

  * Normalize corpauthor|corpcredit|orgname|publishername

  * Normalize output of contrib instances.

  * Handle instances of address/otheraddr/ulink in author et al in the
    same way as email instances; that is, display them on the same
    linke as the author, editor, etc., name.

  * Don't number or link-list any Ulink instance whose string value is
    identical to the value of its url attribute. Just display it inline.

  * Improved handling of cases with sibling contrib, authorblurb, or
    personblurb instances.

  * Handle instances of authorblurb or personblurb that lack sibling
    *name or email content. Also, make sure space gets properly
    normalized in para and simpara within authorblurb or personblurb.

  * Output linebreak before start of .RS macro in nested lists. Closes
    bug #1524573. Thanks to Sam Steingold.

  * Normalize space in Refsect/title output.

  * Don't output punctuation between Refname and Refpurpose if
    Refpurpose is empty. Also corrected handling of Refsect2/title
    instances, and removed some debugging stuff that was generated in
    manpages output to mark the ends of sections.

  * Added new email.delimiters.enabled param. If non-zero (the
    default), delimiters are generated around e-mail addresses (output
    of the email element). If zero, the delimiters are suppressed.

  * Reverted suppression of markup for refsect1 instances with empty titles.

  * Suppressed output of .SH markup for Refsect1 instances with empty
    titles.

  * In manpages output, if the last/nearest *info element for
    particular Refentry has multiple Copyright and/or Legalnotice
    children, process them all (not just the first ones). Closes bug
    1524576. Thanks to Sam Steingold for the report and to Daniel
    Leidert for providing a patch.

  * Made some minor fixes and clarifications to comments in the
    charmap.groff.xsl file.

      displayed as inline content rather than as block content.

    othercredit.like.author.enabled:
      If non-zero, output of the othercredit element on titlepages is
      displayed in the same style as author and editor output. If zero
      (the default), othercredit output is displayed using a style
      different than that of author and editor.

    blurb.on.titlepage.enabled:
      If non-zero, output from authorblurb and personblurb elements is
      displayed on title pages. If zero (the default), output from
