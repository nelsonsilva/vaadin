Design of License System for IT Mill Toolkit
============================================

License-file
------------

Each web application using Toolkit must have a valid license -file
filename: itmill-license.xml
placement: either in WEB-INF directory or given in Application init


License number
--------------

Each license is uniquely numbered with randomized number between 0 and 2^63

Web directory
-------------

License file can be downloaded from the url:
http://license.itmill.com/license/<license number>/itmill-license.xml

Downloading does not require password - sparse license number space is gives _enough_ protection for license-files.
Web directory can be (in the beginning) easily implemented with static files


File contents
-------------

See example license-files in https://svn.itmill.com/svn/itmill-toolkit/doc/project/license-system
