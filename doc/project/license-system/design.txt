Design of License System for IT Mill Toolkit
============================================

License-file
------------

Each web application using Toolkit must have a valid license -file
filename: itmill-toolkit-license.xml
placement: either in WEB-INF directory or given in Application init


License number
--------------

Each license is uniquely numbered with randomized number between 0 and 2^63

Web directory
-------------

License file can be downloaded with POST request from the url:
https://license.itmill.com/getlicense/itmill-toolkit-license.xml
The post request must have a parameter called 'license-number' that contains the license number.

Downloading does not require other passwords - sparse license number space is gives _enough_ protection for license-files.

Downloading mechanism is designed to be used (and implemented) later for automatic license reneval and maybe
possibly license enforcement. Implementation of both the server or client side of these mechanisms are postponed
to the later milestone when they are really needed.


Web based license management
----------------------------

http://license.itmill.com/ contails Web UI for buying and managing licenses. 
This service will be designed by marketing as a part of web-shop project.
