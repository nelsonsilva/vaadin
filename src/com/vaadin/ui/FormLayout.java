 * FormLayout caption is rendered on left side of component. Required and
 * validation indicators are between captions and fields.
 * 
 * FormLayout does not currently support some advanced methods from
 * OrderedLayout like setExpandRatio and setComponentAlignment.
 * 
 * FormLayout by default has component spacing on. Also margin top and margin
 * bottom are by default on.
