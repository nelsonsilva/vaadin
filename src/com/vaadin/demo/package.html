<p>Provides several fully functional Vaadin example applications. These
highlight certain aspects of the toolkit and how it can be
used to produce simple, elegant yet powerful user interface driven
applications.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HelloWorld</strong> is the classic example which only prints the
text "Hello, World!" on the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Calc</strong> implements a calculator application which
demonstrates how to build a bit more complicated user interface and how the
application can interact with the user through that interface.</li>
</ul>
