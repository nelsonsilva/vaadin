<!-- Package summary here -->

<p>Provides several fully functional MillStone example applications. These
highlight certain aspects of the MillStone framework and how it can be
exploited to produce simple, elegant yet powerful user interface driven
applications.</p>

<p><ul>
<li><strong>HelloWorld</strong> is the classic example which only prints the
text "Hello, World!" on the screen.
<li><strong>LoginExample</strong> is almost as simple as HelloWorld. It
demonstrates how to use the optional login procedure available to MillStone
applications.
<li><strong>Calc</strong> implements a calculator application which
demonstrates how to build a bit more complicated user interface and how the
application can interact with the usern through that interface.
