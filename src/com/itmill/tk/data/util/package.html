<p>Provides various utility classes that implement the MillStone data layer
functionality.</p>

<p>The first {@link org.millstone.base.data.Property Property} class,
{@link org.millstone.base.data.util.ObjectProperty ObjectProperty}, provides
a simple class containing a typed data value. The second,
{@link org.millstone.base.data.util.MethodProperty MethodProperty}, provides
a way to bind a field of an object to the Property interface using the
accessor methods for the field.</p>

<p>The next level of the MillStone data layer, the
{@link org.millstone.base.data.Item Item}, is implemented by 
{@link org.millstone.base.data.util.BeanItem BeanItem}, though it is only a
simple wrapper to the former to provide the Item interface for any regular
Java Bean.</p>

<p>The third level, the {@link org.millstone.base.data.Container Container},
has several implementations in the {@link org.millstone.base.data.util}
package.</p>
