<h1>IT Mill Toolkit - Licensing Guidelines</h1>

Licensing in nutshell:
<ul>
	<li>Free for learning, development and testing</li>
	<li>Free for small production deployments (max 4 concurrent active users per server)</li>
	<li>Commercial license is required for larger production environment</li>
	<li>For distributing IT Mill Toolkit as a part of your own
	product, either purchase suitable commercial deployment licenses or
	contact us for OEM-license tailored for your needs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When I can use IT Mill Toolkit for free?</h3>

<p>Application development is complitely free. Furthermore, you can deploy 
the developed application for testing and validation at the development time.</p>

<p>You can obtain a free license for production use in small workgroups from
<a href="http://www.itmill.com/">IT Mill License store</a>. This license 
covers use of 4 active users concurrently
using the application in one server.</p>

<h3>When I must obtain a commercial license?</h3>

<p>A commercial license must be obtained for production use of the 
applications that use IT Mill Toolkit libraries. Free and low-cost license
alternatives for limited number of concurrent users are available.</p>

<p>A deployment license is required for each deployed copy of a program
that uses Toolkit library. To be more exact, each Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) that runs a program that uses IT Mill Toolkit libraries, must have an
unique deployment license. For example, if the program is
deployed to multiple servers (for load balancing or other reasons), each
server needs an unique license.</p>

<h2>Purchasing Commercial License</h2>

<p>Deployment licenses can be purchased online from <a
	href="http://www.itmill.com/">IT Mill Ltd</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in OEM-license for your product, please
contact sales at <a href="http://www.itmill.com/">IT Mill Ltd</a>.</p>

<h2>License terms</h2>

<p>The actual legal license text is in <a href="license.txt">license.txt</a>.</p>

<h2>License files?</h2>

<p>Technically license is stored as itmill-toolkit-license.xml -file, that is usually
store in WEB-INF -directory of the web-application. The license file 
contains information about the scope and limitations of the lisence in fairly readable
form, so you might want to check the file contents. Toolkit package is shipped with
unlimited license for development and testing purposes.</p>

<h2>Open Source Edition?</h2>

<p>The previous version 3 of the product was called Millstone User Interface Library. 
Millstone library was licensed with very liberal LGPL-license. The new version 4 of 
the library, is not licensed with open source license. The latest free release of 
Millstone User Interface Library (version 3.1) can still be found from sourceforge.</p>

<p>Why did we change the license? Putting a clear transparent pricing model on the 
product makes our customers decision-making easier. They know how much they are
paying for and what whey get for their money.</p>

<h2>Educational use</h2>

<p>If you want to use the IT Mill Toolkit for teaching programming, web
development or user interface design, you can apply for educational
license by contacting sales at <a href="http://www.itmill.com/">IT
Mill Ltd</a>.</p>
