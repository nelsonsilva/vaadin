<h1>Millstone Licensing Guidelines</h1>

Millstone follows the following rules of thumb for its licensing:
<ul>
	<li>Free for learning, development and testing</li>
	<li>Commercial deployment license is required for deploying any
	program that uses Millstone libraries to production use</li>
	<li>For distributing Millstone libraries as a part of your own
	product, there is two alternatives:
	<li>Purchasing commercial deployment licenses for each deployed
	copy of the product.</li>
	<li>If you plan to deploy at least 5 copies of the product, you
	can contact IT Mill Ltd for OEM-license tailored for your products
	needs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When I can use Millstone for free?</h3>

Development of applications and products using Millstone tools and
libraries is complitely free. Furthermore, you can deploy the developed
program for testing and validation at the development time. Any
production (or real) use of the deployed program with Millstone
libraries requires commercial deployment license.

<h3>When I must obtain a commercial license for Millstone</h3>

A deployment license is required for each deployed copy of a program
that uses Millstone libraries. To be more exact, each Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) that runs a program that uses Millstone libraries, must an
unique commercial deployment license. For example, if the program is
deployed to multiple servers (for load balancing or other reasons), each
server needs an unique license. Deployment for testing the program
during development phase is permitted without a license if the deployed
program is not used for any production or real use.
