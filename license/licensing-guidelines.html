		<h1><a name="commercial"/>Commercial License</h1>
		
		
		
		Licensing in nutshell:
		<ul>
			<li>Free for learning, development and testing</li>
			<li>Commercial license is required for production environment</li>
			<li>For distributing IT Mill Toolkit as a part of your own
			product, either purchase suitable commercial deployment licenses or
			contact us for OEM-license tailored for your needs.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Free use</h3>
		
		<p>Application development is complitely free. Furthermore, you can deploy 
		the developed application for testing and validation at the development time.</p>
		
		<h3>Commercial use</h3>
		
		<p>A commercial license must be obtained for production use of the 
		applications that use IT Mill Toolkit libraries.</p>
		
		<p>A deployment license is required for each deployed copy of a program
		that uses Toolkit library. To be more exact, each Java Virtual
		Machine (JVM) that runs a program that uses IT Mill Toolkit libraries, must have an
		unique deployment license. For example, if the program is
		deployed to multiple servers (for load balancing or other reasons), each
		server needs an unique license.</p>
		
		<p>If the number of server installations is so high that separate deployment
		licenses are not an option, please contact <a href="http://www.itmill.com/">sales</a>
		to hear about OEM licensing options.</p>
		
		<h2>Purchasing Commercial License</h2>
		
		<p>Deployment licenses can be purchased online from <a
			href="http://www.itmill.com/">IT Mill Ltd</a>.</p>
		
		<p>If you are interested in OEM-license for your product, please
		contact sales at <a href="http://www.itmill.com/">IT Mill Ltd</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>License terms</h2>
		
		<p>The actual legal license text is in <a href="license.pdf">license.pdf</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>License files</h2>
		
		<p>Technically license is stored as itmill-toolkit-license.xml -file, that is usually
		store in WEB-INF -directory of the web-application. The license file 
		contains information about the scope and limitations of the license in fairly readable
		form, so you might want to check the file contents. Toolkit package is shipped with
		unlimited license for development and testing purposes.</p>
		
		<p>Free unlimited development license <a href="lib/itmill-toolkit-license.xml">
		license-file</a> is included in product package in 
		lib -directory</p>
		
		<h2>Open Source Edition</h2>
		
		<p>The previous version 3 of the product was called Millstone User Interface Library. 
		Millstone library was licensed with very liberal LGPL-license. The latest free release of 
		Millstone User Interface Library (version 3.1) can still be found from sourceforge.</p>
		
		<p>The new version 4 of the library, now called IT Mill Toolkit, is not licensed with 
		an open source license. This does not mean that the sources are closed, source code is 
		included in the product package for your convenience. </p>
		
		<p>Why did we change the license? Putting a clear transparent pricing model on the 
		product makes our customers decision-making easier. They know how much they are
		paying for and that they can expect commercial grade quality product for their money.</p>
		
		<h2>Educational use</h2>
		
		<p>If you want to use the IT Mill Toolkit for teaching programming, web
		development or user interface design, you can apply for educational
		license by contacting sales at <a href="http://www.itmill.com/">IT
		Mill Ltd</a>.</p>
